# EcoFOCI Data Philosophy

S.Bell - Keep all raw instrument data available.  Do not edit initial copy if possible.  Remove little data and alternatively flag all data with known characteristics.  Stick to **standards** (CF/COARDS/ACDD) where ever possible.

Similar ideology for programming.  Try to avoid reinventing the wheel.  Use community tools and open source tools where possible.

## EPIC (pre-2015)
Data storage descriptor and tools for data analysis.  Long since EOL / deprecated but has legacy users and sets the tone for older philosophies.
