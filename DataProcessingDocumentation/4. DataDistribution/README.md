# General Summary

There are multiple required pathways that are a part of getting EcoFOCI data into the public or proper stakeholders hands as well as mandatory data archives and repositories.  Although one section of this documentation is dedicated to those sources, it is likely to be merely a listing of locations EcoFOCI data can be found and not a full description beyond those dataset existances.

The *PMEL SPONSERED* Data Distribution is what is available on site for the entire lab.  This has historically been either EPIC tools (deprecated long ago and barely on life support) and ERDDAP 

The *Internal* data distribution is what is available directly from the EcoFOCI archive.  It exists either as raw files made available via ftp/sftp connections to networked computers, via portable disk transfer and occasionally GDrive archives, and more likely and completely as an internal (PMEL only) ERDDAP database.
