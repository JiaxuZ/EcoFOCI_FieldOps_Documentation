# Documentation for EcoFOCI Data Processing and Documentation

This is an evolving repository for EcoFOCI related documentation particularly of interest to data processing, data distribution, and data/meta data acquisition and archiving.

It will spell out the primary resources available, the primary tools that are used, and point to some strengths and weeknesses.  It will guide some of the future development by documenting choices (with links to references or standards where applicable), and provide clues and cross-links with other tools maintained in various github repositories and at PMEL that are useful for EcoFOCI data work.
