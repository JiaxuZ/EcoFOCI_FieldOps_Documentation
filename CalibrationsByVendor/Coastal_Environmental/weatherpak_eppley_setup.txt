Hi, David,
The WEATHERPAK calculates the output of the Eppley radiometer using the calibration constants provided by Eppley labs for that specific sensor.
The Sensor Record in the WP configuration file for the Eppley multiplies the output voltage from the sensor by the coefficient for the value in W/m^2.  That value is averaged over the 10 minute sample duration and logged in memory at the end of the sample duration.
If you are connecting a different Eppley radiometer than originally used with a WEATHERPAK and you do not already have the new coefficient you will need to calculate the new coefficient from the calibration constant provided by Eppley.  New coefficient = 1/calibration constant.
You can enter the corresponding coefficient in the sensor record by following these steps:
1) Connect to the WEATHERPAK via the RS232 serial connection with the following settings:
     Baud Rate: 9600
     Bits:  8
     Parity: None
     Stop Bits: 1
     Flow Control: None

6) The calibration coefficient for the Eppley sensor is in Item 14.  To change the coefficient, type c14/xxxxxx<enter> where xxxxxx is the new calibration coefficient.
 
7) Verify that the new coefficient has been entered in the sensor record.  If not, repeat step 6.
 
8) Go to the ZENO Program menu (z<enter>) and save the change to the EEPROM (e<enter>). 
 
9) When the save is completed type q<enter> to quit the User Menu and return to normal operation.
 
 
 
The hex value transmitted via ARGOS is calculated from the average value used for the logged data.  The logged value in W/m^2 is multiplied by 0.18214 to give the hex value transmitted by ARGOS.
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
